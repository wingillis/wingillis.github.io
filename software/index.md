<!-- REWRITE!!! make a bit more professional -->
<!-- # Outline
- [x] background about my programming abilities
- Describe the main highlights I've used my programming for
  1. Building and managing MoSeq, building real-time MoSeq
  2. Data analysis, pipelining, and figure generation
  3. Building hardware and experiments -->

# Software, firmware, hardware

## Background

Back in 2012, I followed the newly constructed and free [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) course that taught the fundamentals of programming through javascript.
The lessons were sparse and short, but enough to fuel my excitement to explore the new world of possibilities software development provided.

<!-- Describe general experience with different programming languages, paradigms, and platforms -->
Over the years, I've developed expertise programming with the following languages, listed in order of comfort level:
1) **python**, 2) **javascript**, 3) **julia**, 4) **c**, 5) **matlab**, and gathered experience in other languages such as lua, clojure, groovy, c# and go.
There are similarities many languages share making it easier to take up a new language, but also differences that make some
languages a better choice to solve certain problems. I've had fun thinking about how languages and their accompanying frameworks
are best suited to solve different problems.

I've continued to practice software engineering and other programming-adjacent skills in college and graduate school.

## Graduate school projects

The projects I've worked on in graduate school are usually built to conduct customized experiments.

### Real-time MoSeq

### MoSeq v2

## Pre-graduate school projects

### Consulting: wireless control of peripheral nerve stimulation

## Hobby projects

- [Tic-Toc](/tic-toc/) (made **BEFORE** TikTok was big), a web app for making serial timers (user guide [here](https://wingillis.github.io/blog/tic-toc/)).
- As a consultant, I co-engineered a system to monitor and control wireless **peripheral nerve stimulators**. I built the front-end user interface to select various stimulation patterns, and the back-end which tracks and manages the stimulator devices.

- I built an automatic system to parse sound files for birdsong â€“ it heavily relies on [Jeff Markowitz's scripts](https://github.com/jmarkow/zftftb)
- I built [this website](https://github.com/wingillis/wingillis.github.io) using jekyll and github pages.
- A web-based timer utilizing [Trello](https://trello.com) for task management [source](https://github.com/wingillis/trelloAlarm)

- A [fun little art project](/software/fireworks/) that shoots small circles around the webpage

- A free Android app called Maybe Later
  - If you ever find yourself wanting to remember small things here-and-there, but you don't want to schedule a time to remember it, this app is for you! It will randomly remind you what you want in around a day, week, or month.
  - **NOTE**: I haven't updated Maybe Later in years, so it's not available on the Android app store any more.
