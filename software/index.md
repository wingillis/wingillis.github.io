I became interested in programming when I found a site called
[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) in 2012-2013,
which was just in its baby phase. It only offered a small amount of lessons in programming, but when I took the course in javascript fundamentals, it gave me the excitement, motivation and confidence to move forward with my education in software development. Since then, I have been able to develop the things showcased below.

- [Tic-Toc](/tic-toc/), a web app for making serial timers (user guide [here](https://wingillis.github.io/blog/tic-toc/))
- A free Android app called [Maybe Later](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wgillis.maybelater&hl=en)
  - If you ever find yourself wanting to remember small things here-and-there,
    but you don't want to schedule a time to remember it, this app is for you!
    It will randomly remind you what you want in around a day, week, or month.
- As a consultant with **Micro-Leads, Inc.**, I co-engineered a system to monitor and
  control wireless (bluetooth) **peripheral nerve stimulators**. I built both the
  front-end (user interface for selecting stimulation patterns) and the back-end
  (bluetooth device tracker and power-pad manager) to allow for semi-complex stimulation
  patterns.

- I love to use software to perform data analysis. I use python on a daily basis to process data, build predictive models, and to visualize relationships in the data

- I built an automatic system to parse sound files for birdsong, based on [Jeff Markowitz's scripts](https://github.com/jmarkow/zftftb)
- [This website](https://github.com/wingillis/wingillis.github.io)
- A [genetic algorithm](https://github.com/wingillis/geneticSounds) that tries to copy a sound (**spoiler alert:** it doesn't work)
- A web-based timer utilizing [Trello](https://trello.com) for task management [source](https://github.com/wingillis/trelloAlarm)

- A [fun little art project](/software/fireworks/) for visualization
