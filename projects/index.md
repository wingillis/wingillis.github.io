## Projects I am working on

#### Research (Gardner Lab)

<b>Micro-scale cuff electrodes</b> for the peripheral nervous system.

<b>Intrafascicular CNT electrodes</b> for long-term nerve recordings.

<b>Ultra-small carbon fiber electrode arrays</b> for precise nerve and cortical recordings

<b>Super-high-density silicon carbide electrode arrays</b> for extremely high density nerve and cortical recordings and stimulation.

#### Hobby Projects
<b>Building a bike!</b>

Understanding machine learning so I can apply it to things.

A machine supervised genetic algorithm to produce sounds that I think could possibly be the best-sounding sound in the world.
