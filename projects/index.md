#### Past Research in the [Gardner Lab](http://people.bu.edu/timothyg/index.html)

**Micro-scale cuff electrodes** for the peripheral nervous system.
<!-- add a note about these cuffs how they were built and what not -->

<b>Intrafascicular CNT electrodes</b> for long-term nerve recordings.

<b>Ultra-small carbon fiber electrode arrays</b> for precise nerve and cortical recordings

<b>Super-high-density silicon carbide electrode arrays</b> for extremely high density nerve and cortical recordings and stimulation.

<!-- #### Hobby Projects
<b>Building a bike!</b>

Understanding machine learning so I can apply it to things.

A machine supervised genetic algorithm to produce sounds that I think could possibly be the best-sounding sound in the world.
