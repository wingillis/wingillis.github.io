# About me

<!-- TODO: add current interests -->

I received a PhD from the [Program in Neuroscience](https://www.proquest.com/openview/309703ec077ee2add7bb400c0d20f156/1) at Harvard Medical School.
I studied how the [basal ganglia](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30512-9) organizes [animal behavior](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05611-2).

<!-- TODO: incorporate some of the technical skills here - like closed-loop behavior detection and brain manipulation system -->

Before that, I was a research technician at Boston University, where I developed [nerve cuff electrode arrays](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/aa5a5b) to record and stimulate peripheral nerves.
