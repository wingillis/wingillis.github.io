# About me
I recevied a PhD from the [Program in Neuroscience](http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/neuroscience/) at Harvard Medical School.
I studied how the brain (specifically, the basal ganglia) orchestrates animal behavior in [Bob Datta's](http://datta.hms.harvard.edu/research_new2.html) lab.
Prior to September 2016, I was a research technician in [Timothy Gardner's](http://people.bu.edu/timothyg/) laboratory in Boston University, where I developed peripheral nerve recording methods with cuff electrode arrays and flexible carbon nanotube threads.
In 2014, I received my B.A. degree at Boston University specializing in Behavioral Biology.

I am fascinated by how easily animals (including humans) are able join actions into complex movement sequences.
This process is very much tied to the environment the animal interacts with.
Animals have a large repertoire of actions they can choose from â€“ how do they make their choice in the context of a specific environment?

Currently, I study how a group of subcortical brain structures, collectively known as the basal ganglia, are involved in two processes:
- influencing action selection
- learning to perform specific actions

<!--TODO: expand upon my project somewhat-->

Some of my hobbies include making electronic gadgets, building web apps, and rendering 3d models. Some of my software projects are described [here](software/), some of my gadgets are [here](blog/), and 3d models are [here](gallery/).
