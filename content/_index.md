# About me
I recevied a PhD from the [Program in Neuroscience](http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/neuroscience/) at Harvard Medical School.
I studied how the [basal ganglia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_ganglia) organizes [animal behavior](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05611-2) in [Bob Datta's](http://datta.hms.harvard.edu/research_new2.html) lab.

Before that, I was a research technician in [Timothy Gardner's](http://people.bu.edu/timothyg/) laboratory in Boston University, where I developed [nerve cuff electrode arrays](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/aa5a5b) to record and stimulate peripheral nerves.

Some of my hobbies include making electronic gadgets, building web apps, and rendering 3d models. Some of my software projects are described [here](software/), some of my gadgets are [here](blog/), and 3d models are [here](gallery/).
