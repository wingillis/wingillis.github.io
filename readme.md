# Hello!

I'm glad you took some time to stop by.
Here is the source code for my [website](https://wingillis.github.io/).

It's built with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), plus a lot of additional components, like [vue.js](http://vuejs.org/v2/guide/).

To publish the blog, first run `./deploy.sh` and then run `./remaster.sh`
