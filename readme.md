Hello!

I'm glad you took some time to stop by.
This is the source code for my [website](https://wingillis.github.io/).
It's built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and some additional components are built with [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/).

It was originally built with Jekyll, but I found it difficult to maintain and update.
