I am a PhD candidate in the [Program in Neuroscience](http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/neuroscience/) at Harvard Medical School. I study how the brain orchestrates animal behavior in [Bob Datta's](http://datta.hms.harvard.edu/research_new2.html) lab. Prior to September 2016, I was a research technician in [Timothy Gardner's](http://people.bu.edu/timothyg/) laboratory in Boston University, where I developed peripheral nerve recording methods with cuff electrode arrays and flexible carbon nanotube threads. I got my degree at Boston University in Behavioral Biology.

I am fascinated by the complex movements animals (and humans) make, and their ablity to perform them with ease. Placed in a broader context, the way animals perform these movements and the patterns they are performed within are very much related to the environment. Animals have a large repertoire of actions they can choose from â€“ how do they make their choice?

Currently, I study how a group of subcortical brain structures, collectively known as the basal ganglia, are involved in two main processes:
- influencing action selection
- learning to perform specific actions

<!--TODO: expand upon my project somewhat-->

Some of my hobbies include making electronic gadgets, building web apps, and rendering 3d models. Some of my software projects are described [here](software/), some of my gadgets are [here](blog/), and my 3d models are [here](gallery/).
