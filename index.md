I am a PhD candidate in the [Program in Neuroscience](http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/neuroscience/) at Harvard Medical School. I study how the brain orchestrates animal behavior in [Bob Datta's](http://datta.hms.harvard.edu/research_new2.html) lab. Prior to September 2016, I was a research technician in [Timothy Gardner's](http://people.bu.edu/timothyg/) laboratory in Boston University, where I developed peripheral nerve recording methods with cuff electrode arrays and flexible carbon nanotube threads. I got my degree at Boston University in Behavioral Biology.

I am interested in many things. These include:

- Neural representation of sensory and motor information
- Experimental design of neuroscientific experiments
- Using machine learning principles to tease out meaningful information out of large swaths of data (imaging, electrophysiology, auditory, textual)
- Software development projects which involve languages like:
  - [python](https://www.python.org/) and all of its amazing, enabling packages! Python is the language I use the most.
  - javascript for building web applications - [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) is my favorite web framework for building web-based applications. It's easy to use and understand, and doesn't require an extensive toolchain to compile the application
  - [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) - because I have to
  - C to program [arduinos](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno) and other microcontrollers, [like the teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.html)
  - clojure - this language is a LISP that runs on the java virtual machine (JVM). It's designed to be purely functional, which may be useful to change the way I think about dataflow.
  - Groovy: Groovy is a cool language because it's a dynamic language that runs on the JVM, and is writeen in a way that makes inventing a domain-specific language (DSL) easy. For instance, [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/), a pipelining tool designed to parallelize jobs for high-performance computing clusters, is a DSL written on top of Groovy
  - I have used java in the past to develop a few android applications with simple features.

An enumeration of some old projects are listed [here](software/).
