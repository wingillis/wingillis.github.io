I am a first year PhD candidate in neuroscience at Harvard Medical School.
Previously, I was a research technician in [Dr. Timothy Gardner's](http://people.bu.edu/timothyg/) laboratory in Boston University.
I got my B.A. in Behavioral Biology at BU, too.


I am interested in many things. These include:
- Neural representation of sensory and motor information
- Using modern techniques to understand the above subjects
- Using machine learning principles to tease out meaningful information out of large swaths of data (imaging, electrophysiology, auditory, textual)
- Programming, using languages like:
  - [python](https://www.python.org/) and all of its amazing, enabling packages!
  - [julia](http://julialang.org/) - it has a lot of promise in technical computing
  - javascript/web applications
  - java
  - MATLAB
  - C/arduino
  - clojure/clojurescript
  - [Software Development](/software/)

  - Electronics Development:
    - Hand typing machine
    - 3D modeling and design
    - Biking!
    - What it means to be 'conscious'
    - Building arduino things
    - Learning about past civilizations
