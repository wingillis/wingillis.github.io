I am a PhD candidate in the [Program in Neuroscience](http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/neuroscience/) at Harvard Medical School. I study how the brain orchestrates animal behavior in [Bob Datta's](http://datta.hms.harvard.edu/research_new2.html) lab. Prior to September 2016, I was a research technician in [Timothy Gardner's](http://people.bu.edu/timothyg/) laboratory in Boston University, where I developed peripheral nerve recording methods with cuff electrode arrays and flexible carbon nanotube threads. I got my degree at Boston University in Behavioral Biology.

I am interested in many things. These include:

- Neural representation of sensory and motor information
- Experimental design of neuroscientific experiments
- Using machine learning principles to tease out meaningful information out of large swaths of data (imaging, electrophysiology, auditory, textual)
- Software development projects which involve languages like:
  - [python](https://www.python.org/) and all of its amazing, enabling packages!
  - [julia](http://julialang.org/) - it has a lot of promise in technical computing and ML
  - javascript/web applications - [vue.js](http://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) is my favorite framework
  - [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) - because I have to
  - C to program [arduinos](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno) and other microcontrollers, [like the teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.html)
  - clojure/clojurescript - to change the way I think about data transformations
  - java for android applications

An enumeration of some old projects are listed [here](software/).
