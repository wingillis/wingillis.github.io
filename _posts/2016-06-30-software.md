I became interested in programming when I found a site called
[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) in 2012-2013,
which was just in its baby phase. It only offered a small amount of lessons in programming, but when I took the course in javascript fundamentals, it gave me the excitement, motivation and confidence to move forward with my education in software development. Since then, I have been able to develop the things showcased below.

- [Tic-Toc](/tic-toc.html)
- a web app for making serial timers
- Bluetooth stimulator interface to conduct peripheral nerve studies
- Various data analysis scripts written in python and MATLAB to make figures
- An automatic system to parse sound files for birdsong
- A free app for Android called [Maybe Later](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wgillis.maybelater&hl=en)
- A (work-in-progress) game written in javascript called Wyzics
- This website
- A genetic algorithm that tries to copy a sound
- A web-based timer utilizing [Trello](https://trello.com) for task management
